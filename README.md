*	I'm starting to think that debugging is just another word for 'searching for the needle in the haystack'.
*	I didn't choose the debugging life, the debugging life chose me.
*	I'd tell you a joke about bugs in code, but it would probably just crash and burn.
*	Who needs sleep when you have debugging to do?
*	I'm not sure which is worse: being stuck in an infinite loop or being stuck in a meeting that never ends.
*	Debugging is like playing hide and seek with a toddler - you think you know where they are, but then they surprise you.

*	I'm pretty sure that the only thing worse than a null pointer exception is two null pointer exceptions.
*	Debugging is like being a detective, except the clues are all in a foreign language.
*	I'm pretty sure my code is allergic to success, because every time it gets close to working, it breaks.
*	I don't always debug my code, but when I do, I prefer to do it with some good music playing in the background.
*	Debugging is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded, except the cube is also on fire.

*	Debugging is like being a gardener, except instead of pulling out weeds, you're pulling out bugs.
*	I don't always debug my code, but when I do, I prefer to do it in a dark room with some snacks and a good movie.
*	Debugging is like trying to find your way out of a maze, except the maze keeps changing.
